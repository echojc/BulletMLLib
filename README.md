## BulletMLLib

A C# library used to read and run BulletML files based on the [implementation
by Keiichi Kashihara](https://sites.google.com/site/bandlegames/bulletml-c) of
Bandle Games, itself based on the [spec by ABA
Games](http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~cs8k-cyu/bulletml/index_e.html).

This is a fork of
[dmanning23/BulletMLLib](https://github.com/dmanning23/BulletMLLib) focusing on
having as few external dependencies as possible.

## BulletML

[dmanning23's wiki](https://github.com/dmanning23/BulletMLLib/wiki) is a great
reference for writing bulletML scripts.

You can also refer to the [reference
specification](http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~cs8k-cyu/bulletml/bulletml_ref_e.html)
at ABA Games.
